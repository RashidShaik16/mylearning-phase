# 🎯 JavaScript DOM Challenges

This folder contains various small projects and challenges built using **HTML, TailwindCSS, and JavaScript** to practice DOM manipulation and UI logic.

## 🚀 Live Challenge Dashboard

Instead of separate READMEs for each challenge, I’ve created a centralized, beautiful dashboard where you can access and preview every challenge:

## 📁 Structure

Each folder inside this directory is a standalone project with its own `index.html`, CSS (usually TailwindCSS), and JavaScript logic. The live dashboard fetches them from the `/docs` folder for hosting via GitHub Pages.

## ✨ Tools Used

- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
- TailwindCSS
- GitHub Pages for deployment
- Visual Studio Code

## 📝 Notes

More challenges will be added as I continue learning!
